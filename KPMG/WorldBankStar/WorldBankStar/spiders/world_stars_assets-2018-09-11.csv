The defendant company received and held the proceeds of criminal conduct perpetrated by its controlling mind and beneficial owner, Samuel Gichuru. The company knowingly enabled Gichuru to obtain substantial bribes paid to him while he held public office in Kenya. The company played a vital role without which corruption on a grand scale is impossible: money laundering. 2. Gichuru was the chief executive of Kenya?s power utility, the Kenya Power & Lighting Company (?KPLC?) from November 1984 until February 2003.

He also stated that the account was opened for the receipt of fees which he earned from business introductions and as a consultant.  In about 1986, he was advised by the Jersey office of Deloitte & Touche (forerunner to the respondents, ""Walbrook"") that his needs would be better served by having a company.

Walbrook is the administrator of Windward and provides its directors and secretary.  Windward had bank accounts with HSBC Bank Plc and the Royal bank of Scotland International Limited, to which Walbrook provided signatories to the accounts.  The Court stated that Mr. Gichuru is the beneficial owner of Windward and the various Walbrook entities hold the shares as nominees for him. In May 2002, Walbrook filed a Suspicious Activity Report with the police and the police did not give consent to Walbrook making any payments and Walbrook refused to make any payments from Windward to Mr. Gichuru since then.  On August 21, 2003, a notice under the Investigation of Fraud (Jersey) Law 1990 was issued by the Attorney General demaning documents and information.

Illicit enrichment is an offence in some countries where a public official gains a significant increase in his assets which he/she cannot reasonably explain in relation to his/her lawful income. This is a crime that is generally not considered punishable in many countries like the UK and Singapore, making enforcement of a confiscation order based on such an offence complicated. Further, Singapore does not have a (non-conviction based) civil forfeiture procedure.
