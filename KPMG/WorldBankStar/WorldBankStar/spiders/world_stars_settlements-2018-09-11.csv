In the opinion of the OAG, Alstom SA as the senior holding company is responsible in part for the organizational deficiencies identified. However, after payment of CHF 1 m as reparation and bearing the remaining costs of the proceedings by Alstom SA, the OAG refrained from sanctioning Alstom SA in addition to Alstom Network Schweiz AG regarding the established acts of bribery. It did so particularly considering the demonstrated willingness to cooperate and the considerable improvements in the internal compliance procedures before and after the opening of the investigations.Within the proceedings against Alstom Network Schweiz AG and Alstom SA, the OAG in close cooperation with the Federal Criminal Police investigated further twelve projects in the power station sector, divided over all continents. In this regard, it in some part detected additional breaches of internal compliance regulations. Despite considerable investigative efforts however, no additional acts of bribery could be established for the time after article 102 SCC had come into effect. The proceedings against the two defendant Alstom entities for these additionally investigated twelve projects were dismissed due to the lack of any criminal conduct (Art. 319(1)(a) Swiss Code of Criminal Procedure) and due to the lack of criminal liability of the companies prior to October 2003 (Art. 319(1)(b) Swiss Code of Criminal Procedure), without granting compensation and by imposing the costs m paid by Alstom SA as reparation under Art. 53 SCC was transferred to the International Committee of the Red Cross. One-third of these funds each shall be used in projects of the ICRC in Tunisia, Latvia and Malaysia respectively. The costs allotted for the part of the proceedings resulting in the dismissal amount to about CHF 90,000 and have been imposed on the two Alstom companies for which they are jointly liable.

Alcatel CIT wired more than $18 million to two consultants in Costa Rica, which had been retained by Alcatel Standard, in connection with obtaining business in that country. According to court documents, more than half of this money was then passed on by the consultants to various Costa Rican government officials for assisting Alcatel CIT and Alcatel de Costa Rica in obtaining and retaining business. As part of the scheme, the consultants created phony invoices that they then submitted to Alcatel CIT. According to court documents, senior Alcatel executives approved the retention of and payments to the consultants despite obvious indications that the consultants were performing little or no legitimate work. In addition, according to court documents, Alcatel Standard hired a consultant in Honduras who was a perfume distributor with no experience in telecommunications. The consultant was retained after being personally selected by the brother of a senior Honduran government official. Alcatel CIT executives knew that a significant portion of the money paid to the consultant would be paid to the family of the senior Honduran government official in exchange for favorable treatment of Alcatel CIT. As a result of these payments, Alcatel CIT was able to retain contracts worth approximately $47 million and from which Alcatel earned $870,000. In addition, according to court documents, Alcatel Standard retained two consultants on behalf of another Alcatel subsidiary in Taiwan to assist in obtaining an axle counting contract worth approximately $19.2 million. Alcatel and its joint venture paid these two consultants more than $950,000 despite the fact that neither consultant had telecommunications experience. In fact, according to court documents, Alcatel Standard's purpose for hiring the consultants was so that Alcatel SEL could funnel payments through the consultants to Taiwanese legislators who had influence in the award of the contract.

ICE petitioned the court to be recognized as a victim and entitled to restitution, pursuant to the Crime Victims' Rights Act (18 USC Section 1651), US Federal Rules on Criminal Procedure and the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act (18 USC Section 3663A). ICE argued that it had suffered direct and proximate damage from Alcatel-Lucent's conduct and refuted the argument by the US and Alcatel-Lucent (later supported by the court) that it had been a co-conspirator or co-participant in the bribery scheme.

The US Government's Response to ICE's Petition for Victim Status and Restitution, filed May 23, 2011, argued that ""Under the facts and circumstances in the instant matter, which reflect profound and pervasive corruption at the highest levels of ICE, the government regardless of whether ICE is considered a victim, the government does not believe that restitution should be ordered in this matter, because, under the facts and circumstances present in this case, any restitution calculation woul dbe netirely speculative and would unduly prolong and complicate the sentencing process - something that the law does not support."" The US Government cited the involvement of the ICE board members and high level officers in the Alcatel scheme and as legal basis, US v. Lazarenko, 624 F.3d 1247, 1250-52 (9th Cir. 2010) (an individual who is both a victim and a participant in a money-laundering scheme who profited from the conspiracy cannot qualify as a ""victim"" under restitution statutes), and in footnote 8, refuted ICE's contention that the DOJ had stated that foreign governments or policy. ICE appealed the district court's ruling to the 11th Circuit Appeals Court, but its petition was also denied. The appeals court held that the ""district court did not clearly err in finding that 'Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad' (""ICE""), here seeking to be deemed a ""crime victim,"" actually functions as the offenders' coconspirator. The district court identified the pervasive, constant, and consistent illegal conduct by the ""principals"" (i.e. members of the Board of Directors and management) of ICE, the organization claiming status as a victim under the CVRA.

Alcatel CIT wired more than $18 million to two consultants in Costa Rica, which had been retained by Alcatel Standard, in connection with obtaining business in that country. According to court documents, more than half of this money was then passed on by the consultants to various Costa Rican government officials for assisting Alcatel CIT and Alcatel de Costa Rica in obtaining and retaining business. As part of the scheme, the consultants created phony invoices that they then submitted to Alcatel CIT. According to court documents, senior Alcatel executives approved the retention of and payments to the consultants despite obvious indications that the consultants were performing little or no legitimate work. In addition, according to court documents, Alcatel Standard hired a consultant in Honduras who was a perfume distributor with no experience in telecommunications. The consultant was retained after being personally selected by the brother of a senior Honduran government official. Alcatel CIT executives knew that a significant portion of the money paid to the consultant would be paid to the family of the senior Honduran government official in exchange for favorable treatment of Alcatel CIT. As a result of these payments, Alcatel CIT was able to retain contracts worth approximately $47 million and from which Alcatel earned $870,000. In addition, according to court documents, Alcatel Standard retained two consultants on behalf of another Alcatel subsidiary in Taiwan to assist in obtaining an axle counting contract worth approximately $19.2 million. Alcatel and its joint venture paid these two consultants more than $950,000 despite the fact that neither consultant had telecommunications experience. In fact, according to court documents, Alcatel Standard's purpose for hiring the consultants was so that Alcatel SEL could funnel payments through the consultants to Taiwanese legislators who had influence in the award of the contract.
